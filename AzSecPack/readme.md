## Extension for VA scanning
### 1. What is `AzSecPack`?

First, we have the concept `off-Node Service`

The `Off-Node Service (ONS)` is an agent-based vulnerability scanning solution provided by the C+AI organization to identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the underlying OS (Windows, Linux), OS features (IIS, SQL Server) and 3rd-party software (Adobe, Wireshark).  Off-Node satisfies individual service teams, as well as Microsoft's overall Azure compliance and security requirements for Risk Assessment controls.

Off-Node is fully automated and is `delivered automatically` by `AzSecPack`. Broad and comprehensive deployment of AzSecPack is a `prerequisite` for Off-Node scanning.

Together, AzSecPack and Off-Node provide all the needed compliance audits and controls required for regulatory compliance.

AzSecPack is responsible for monitoring the vulnerabilities and managing the security of the Azure infrastructure.


You may find the AZSecPack on `Linux hosts` or `AKS agent nodes`.
