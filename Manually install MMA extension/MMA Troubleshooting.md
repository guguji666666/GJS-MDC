"The agent could not connect to the Microsoft Operations Management Suite service. Please check that the system either has Internet access, or that a valid HTTP proxy has been configured for the agent"

#### TSG steps on Windows machine (Whether MMA is installed as extension or MSI package)
1. RDP to the VM, go to `Control Panel -> System and Security` and here you could see `Microsoft Monitoring Agent`, click it.

3. Identify network connectivity issue by running the `TestCloudConnectivity` tool. The tool is installed `by default` with the agent in the folder `%SystemRoot%\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent`

Launch cmd with administrator, then run the commands below:
```sh
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent
```
```sh
.\testcloudconnection
```
